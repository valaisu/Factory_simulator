# Description

the final goal is to be able to describe how a factory works
and based on that calculate the optimal order for producing
different parts.

one part of the program is creating the recipes. Each recipe
contains tasks. Tasks contain ingredients, machines needed,
supervision needed, time needed and products.

The user does not need to build a flow chart, it suffices to
only describe the tasks, and the program should based on that
be able to create recipes and build the flow chart.


Once the calculating of the runtime of a single process works,
we can start to add more processes to the queue with different 
deadlines
